# jepsen.datomic

Tests for the Datomic distributed database.

## Quickstart

```
lein run test TODO
```

## Design

Datomic uses a fat client library called a "peer". You can't easily run
multiple peers in a single JVM process, so rather than run several peers inside
of Jepsen directly, we deploy a small Clojure service that embeds the peer
library to each node. That service speaks to Jepsen using an HTTP+EDN API.

Datomic supports multiple storage engines. In this test, we use DynamoDB
storage. This requires an AWS account.
